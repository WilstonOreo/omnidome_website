      possible way of technical collaboration for our show to help us make it happen.
      \nThanks to let me know if this idea could interest you guys. If not, we will
      try to manage on our own to make it happen with your wonderful project Omnidome.

      1 i am back projecting i.e. outside the dome (to make it fully immersive of course)
      2. i want to use multiple syphon textures on the dome with different uv mappings each
      3. i want to blend these with alpha and blend modes like difference, multiply etc.

      Hi Jungs und Mädels,

      interessante Software die Ihr da in der Pipeline habt.
      Ist es möglich eine Vorabversion zum ausprobieren von euch zur Verfügung gestellt zu bekommen?
      Bin aus der Veranstaltungsbranche und Video- und Projetktionstechniker und probiere immer gerne neue Dinge aus.
      Meine Webseite ist www.av-suite.de
      Da ist auch ein Video von einer Produktion mit Millumin auf der Startseite.
      Interessant wäre die Einbindung eurer Software in Millumin mit Syphon.

      Wenn ihr was in Berlin macht, gebt gerne bescheid. Das sehe ich mir auch gerne an.
      Da ich ab und an auch immer wieder dort bin.

      your project.\nI have just started design work on a fully immersive environment
      which is basically designed around a dome dancefloor.\nI have been working in
      the industry for many years now and have been bringing the best available tools
      together to design specialist arena's.\nI would quite like to get working with
      your product, as soon as it is available.\nEven from the media you have here
      I can see that this will be an excelent product.\n\nI am currently based in
      vienna and have contact with many VJ's and so would be able to provide a service
      to many of the artists here.\n\nI will leave it at that but it would be great
      to get a chance to test this software, my first Idea is one of the large fields
      we have available here for testing such items.\n\nThanks for reading, I hope
      to here from you soon.\n\nGeoff Kerrigan\nInfinity Sound and Light "

      Hi,

      I'd like to know if your software is right for the club I'm working.
      We have 9 projector that make a 360 cilindrical projection area that I would like to mapp it. Those you software this type of setup, or is only suitable for dome or cubic mapping?

      Please let me know

      Regards

      Tommy

      Hi,

      We are looking for artists that offer live fulldome performance for dance events in the Netherlands. The idea is to set up a tilted 30m dome in diameter in which live electronic concerts will take place. A show will take about 4 to 5 hours. It is important the show is interactive, meaning the music is not preprogrammed and visuals have to be attuned to the music and crowd.

      Do you offer such services?

      Regards
      Nigel Stift

      Hello! I work with full dome, immersive, and interactive content creation and performance. Our company, based in Los Angeles, as of now is primarily working in a PC based environment, but is very interested in Mac based systems. Would love to try your software, and if you are ever in the LA area, come in and visit our facility! I look forward to hearing from you.

      Hello,

      We have probably met here and there. We spoke briefly on twitter and I think I dropped in on your dome installation during 30c3.

      After taking a closer look at what you are doing in comparison with BlendyDome I would say that your software makes more sense to me.

      At the moment I am in the process of partnering up with OMAi, the creators of Tagtool for iPad, based in Austria. I will be there 'man in Berlin'.

      I am interested in meeting up to discuss possible future collaborations, one such possibility being a live drawing jam in a dome.

      Let me know if and when you have time to chat, face to face being the best bandwidth.

      Kind regards,
      ilan

      Hi

      I have been looking around to try and find a piece of software that will allow me to project onto the inside of a dome shaped tent.

      Do you have a time frame for the release of the software, or alternatively is there a beta version that you are allowing people to test?

      Thanks, I look forward to your response
